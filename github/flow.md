## Git Workflows For Your Team or Project

A Git workflow describes a pattern for you and possibly your team to follow when contributing code to a project.
These patterns often include strategies to handle certain tasks in the lifecycle of an application or project including
- adding features
- fixing bugs
- addressing security vulnerabilites

The two most popular flows are called __Git Flow__ and ___GitHub Flow___

A great explanation of the differences between these two flows can be found [here](https://www.freshconsulting.com/git-development-workflows-git-flow-vs-github-flow/).

### Starting a Project? Which Flow is the Right Flow?

There is not a 'right' flow. Both flows at the end of the day provide well documented and tested strategies for publishing code.
Discuss with your team as well as other teams who have adopted these flows to gather an oppinion and choose the best flow
for your project.
