## Security

By it's very nature (being open) the content you work with on GitHub must conform with the requirements of being labelled as "Public" using the [OCIO Information Security Classification Framework](http://www.cio.gov.bc.ca/cio/informationsecurity/classification/information_security_classification_framework.page) and that your ministry information security officer (MISO) has been contacted to ensure all necessary security controls are in place.

**The Basics** â€“ Start with good coding practices.

There is a [healthy debate](http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/open-source-security.html) in the security community around the use and development of OSS applications and the implications of exposing the code publicly vs keeping it behind closed doors. The debate boils down to the fact that there is no conclusive evidence that deems either Open or Closed source as inherently more secure. It come down to the people (coders) and their willingness to build security into their code. The one thing that coding in the open does for security is that the public scrutiny of a coders work is proven as a motivating factor for "doing it right" from the start.

**What does "Doing it Right" mean?**

- Review the code
	
	Sounds obvious but this step has been skipped by every developer in the world at least once.
- Stay up to date on security best practices

	Most languages, platforms and products have best practices for securing applications - find them, follow them and keep current because security is a moving target.
	
	Here are some examples:
	- [Unix, PHP, Python and general programing](http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/index.html)
	- [WordPress](http://stevegrunwell.github.io/wordpress-security-basics/#/)
	- [Node.js](http://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-security-tips/)
	- [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/writing-secure-code)
