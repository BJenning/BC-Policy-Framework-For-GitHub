## Security

From a BC government policy perspective: By it's very nature (being open) the content you work with on GitHub must conform with the requirements of being labelled as "Public" using the [OCIO Information Security Classification Framework](http://www.cio.gov.bc.ca/cio/informationsecurity/classification/information_security_classification_framework.page) and that your ministry information security officer (MISO) has been contacted to ensure all necessary security controls are in place.

**The Basics** â€“ Start with good coding practices.

There is a [healthy debate](http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/open-source-security.html) in the security community around the use and development of OSS applications and the implications of exposing the code publicly vs keeping it behind closed doors. The debate boils down to the fact that there is no conclusive evidence that deems either Open or Closed source as inherently more secure. It come down to the people (coders) and their willingness to build security into their code. The one thing that coding in the open does for security is that the public scrutiny of a coders work is a motivating factor for "doing it right" from the start.
