# Why do we need this guide?

This Guide is designed to support our venture into the realm of consuming and contributing code and content to GitHub as a government organization. At least initially, the processes for accessing and using GitHub are being managed closely in order to ensure we have a good understanding of the steps and factors necessary for success. This Guide will evolve as we learn and gain more experience – and your questions, comments and suggestions are welcome to help it along. Feel free to comment via GitHub issues.

# What is GitHub and Why are We Using It?

GitHub is an online platform for developers to exchange and collaborate on code.  It is the largest public code-sharing site with over 19 million code repositories and over 8 million people collaborating, sharing code and building amazing things.

There is increasing interest across the public sector in developing or deploying open source software as well as making code that was developed "in-house" available to developers. The Province is using GitHub to harness this collaboration to build software, support innovation, and save time and money. These guidelines aim to encourage employees to use GitHub to contribute their skills and collaborate, and to help identify important requirements and manage risks associated with participating in these activities.
