### Creating a Repository (also called a "repo", basically a project)
-  Choose a path based on whether you are [publishing existing code, initiating a new repository or contributing to an outside repository](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Open-Source-Development-Employee-Guide/Collaborating-Contributing.md)
-  Complete your [Open Content Assessment Checklist](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Open-Source-Development-Employee-Guide/Content-Approval-Checklist.md)
-  Follow [GitHub instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/), and select 'BCGov' as the owner for all new repositories
-  Pick a repository name that follows [best practices](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Gov-Org-HowTo/Naming-Repos.md)---for example typically using lowercase with dashes
-  Ensure the repo contains the minimum required content (LICENSE, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md files)


### ALL github.com/bcgov Repositories
- Every github.com/bcgov repo must have 3 items: LICENSE, README &  CONTRIBUTING files
- Adding a [Contributor Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/) to your repository is [highly encoouraged](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Open-Source-Development-Employee-Guide/Collaborating-Contributing.md)
- [Sample templates](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Gov-Org-HowTo/README.md) are available for all of these 'must have' files


### How to License the Contents of a Repository
- Ensure [authority to LICENSE](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Open-Source-Development-Employee-Guide/Licenses.md) the code and other non-code content in the repository
- Choose [a LICENSE](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Open-Source-Development-Employee-Guide/Licenses.md) for your code (.md files are considered code). The default is the Apache 2.0 LICENSE
- 1-2-3 Apply the Apache 2.0 LICENSE:
(1) Attach appropriate LICENSE file directly in the repository
(2) Add the boiler-plate Apache 2.0 LICENSE to the the bottom of your README.md
(3) Add the boiler-plate Apache 2.0 LICENSE to the comments header of *every source code file* 
- Choose a license for any other content (e.g. docs, wikis and non-code stuff) --- default is [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International, and should look like this at the bottom of your README.md) --- and add to the footer of your README.md
- Repositories can have multiple licenses, for example if there is a mix of code and non-code or if the repo contains open datasets under more than one license

### Privacy, Security & Intellectual Property/Copyright
-  Completing the [Open Content Assessment Checklist](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Open-Source-Development-Employee-Guide/Content-Approval-Checklist.md) helps determine if content can be posted to GitHub by ensuring:
(1) The content is free of [Personal Information](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/privacy) (Privacy)
(2) The content has been labelled 'Public' using the  [Information Security Classification Framework](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/information-security/information-security-classification-framework) (Security)
(3) The content is fully owned by the B.C. government and/or the B.C. government holds the [Intellectual Property/Copyright](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/intellectual-property) for the content
(4) There are no other legal, contractual or policy constraints
